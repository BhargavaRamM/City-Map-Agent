# City-Map-Agent
Implementation of A* algorithm:
  A* algorithm is implemented to find the optimal path when a source and destination are provided to an artificial intelligent agent 
  which uses certain heuristics to calculate the cost of the path. 
  The path consists of Avenues, Streets and Highways.
  The cost of travelling on different paths are different and total cost is calculated from source to destination.
  At each point, the agent select the best choice basing on A*.
  
Task Planner:
  Given certain tasks, the Task_Planner plans the tasks using plan graphs. 
  The planning includes causal links etc., depending on the relation between state and action. 
  Given start state and Final state, it represents all the actions, states and links between them.
